# Library Loan Service (MongoDB + Express + jQuery)

A simple, meaningful web application that demonstrates:
- MongoDB database with 3 collections (`users`, `books`, `loans`)
- Node.js + Express JSON API using MongoDB `find` and `aggregate`
- Front-end client written in JavaScript + jQuery that consumes the API (no direct DB access)
